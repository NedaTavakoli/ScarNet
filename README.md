I will create a detailed README.md file for your GitHub repository based on your uploaded paper. It will include a summary of your work, figures referenced from your paper, and any supplementary sections as needed.

Let me know if there are specific figures or sections you'd like highlighted, or if you'd like the entire paper summarized comprehensively in the README. I'll start drafting!

Scarnet Readme
The README.md file for your GitHub repository has been created and includes detailed information about ScarNet, including figures and methodology. Let me know if you need to make adjustments or add specific details!

The error message fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git means that the directory you are in is not a Git repository. To resolve this, you can either initialize a Git repository or navigate to a directory that is already a Git repository. Here's how to fix this:

Option 1: Navigate to an Existing Git Repository
If you are trying to pull changes from a Git repository:

Confirm you are in the correct directory where the repository is cloned:
powershell
Copy code
cd path\to\repository
Run the git pull command again:
powershell
Copy code
git pull
Option 2: Initialize a New Git Repository
If you want to turn the current directory into a Git repository:

Initialize the repository:
powershell
Copy code
git init
Add a remote repository (if needed):
powershell
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
Pull changes:
powershell
Copy code
git pull origin main
Option 3: Clone the Repository (If It’s Not Cloned Yet)
If you haven’t cloned the repository:

Go to the parent directory where you want the repository to be.
Clone it:
powershell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Navigate into the repository directory:
powershell
Copy code
cd repository
Once in the correct repository directory, you can use git pull successfully. Let me know if you need further clarification!

# ScarNet: A Novel Foundation Model for Automated Myocardial Scar Quantification

## Overview
ScarNet is a deep learning model specifically designed for automated myocardial scar segmentation and quantification in Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) Cardiac MRI. By leveraging a hybrid architecture that integrates MedSAM's Vision Transformer (ViT)-based encoder with a U-Net decoder, ScarNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in scar segmentation and quantification, significantly surpassing existing methods like MedSAM and nnU-Net.

## Features
1. **Hybrid Architecture**:
   - Combines the global context awareness of transformers with the precise localization capabilities of CNNs.
   - Incorporates specialized attention mechanisms, including SE layers and ScarAttention blocks.

2. **Innovative Loss Function**:
   - Combines Dice, Focal, and Cross-Entropy losses to address class imbalance and improve segmentation accuracy.

3. **Robust Performance**:
   - Demonstrates high Dice scores (median = 0.912) for scar segmentation, outperforming existing models.
   - Robust against noise perturbations, ensuring reliability in varying imaging conditions.

4. **Efficient Inference Pipeline**:
   - Designed for seamless integration into clinical workflows.

## Key Results
- ScarNet achieves a median scar Dice score of 0.912, compared to 0.046 for MedSAM and 0.638 for nnU-Net.
- Demonstrates exceptional robustness across different image qualities and noise conditions.

## Methodology
### Dataset
- Retrospective analysis using de-identified LGE images from 736 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
- Training set: 552 patients; Testing set: 184 patients.

### Training Pipeline
1. Image preprocessing and augmentation.
2. Parallel processing through MedSAM and U-Net pathways.
3. Adaptive feature fusion and output generation.

### Loss Function
The multi-component loss function is defined as:
\[ \mathcal{L}_{ScarNet} = \lambda_1 \text{FTL} + \lambda_2 \text{DL} + \lambda_3 \text{CE} \]
- FTL: Focal Tversky Loss
- DL: Dice Loss
- CE: Cross-Entropy Loss

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NedaTavakoli/ScarNet.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
